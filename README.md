###Inspiration

Living in California, our team was keenly aware of how the past few years of wildfires have affected our lives: increasing air pollution, participating in planned public safety power shut-offs, and supporting friends through tragic losses. As we dove into our research, it became clear that the community-level devastation affected communities of all sizes, with an outsized impact on those who are most vulnerable due to their age, education, language ability, mobility, and socio-economic status. As we thought about where we could add value, we wanted to ensure we were prioritizing those who needed the most help. 

Our original vision was to build a defensible-space tool for homeowners to better understand, manage, and implement the jurisdiction's requirements. Interviews in the fire community revealed that over 70% of homes pass on their first inspection, while the remaining 30% often require multiple inspections. The current inspection process is highly manual and inefficient for Cal-Fire; oftentimes inspectors don't return to re-inspect a home due to the progression of the fire season and competing priorities.

This led us to turn our efforts to Cal-Fire, which hires 130 inspectors each year to monitor compliance across their 31M acres of State Responsibility Area (SRA). As we spoke with Cal-Fire, we started to hear pain points around information accessibility and defensible space during live fire events.  

**We decided to investigate the power of remote sensing to detect defensible space during live fire events, optimistic that the combination of this information with social vulnerability data would help to ensure faster, more efficient, and more equitable live fire response.**
